Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field that involves the development of systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language, and even perceiving the environment. AI is driven by algorithms, machine learning models, and vast amounts of data that enable machines to improve their performance over time. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars, AI has transformed industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. As AI continues to advance, it holds the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, making processes more efficient and enhancing human decision-making.
