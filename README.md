# Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) Project using IBM Watson

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to use **IBM Watson** services for converting speech to text (STT) and text to speech (TTS). These services allow developers to create applications that interact with users through natural language.

## Project Overview

The project includes two main functionalities:
1. **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Converts spoken language into written text.
2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts written text into spoken language.

## How AI is Used

### Speech-to-Text (STT)
IBM Watson's **STT** uses advanced **Deep Learning** models that are designed to recognize speech patterns and convert them into text. The process involves two key models:
1. **Acoustic Models**: Recognize and interpret sound patterns. These models analyze raw audio signals, converting them into phonetic symbols. IBM Watson uses **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** or **transformers** to handle this process.
2. **Language Models**: Understand the context of spoken language and refine transcriptions. These models predict words and phrases based on sentence structure and context, using **n-gram** models or **neural networks** to improve transcription accuracy.

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)
For **TTS**, IBM Watson relies on neural network-based models to synthesize human-like speech. The two main components are:
1. **Neural Networks for Speech Synthesis**: Watson uses deep learning techniques to generate natural-sounding speech, similar to **WaveNet** models.
2. **Prosody and Phonetic Models**: Ensure the speech sounds smooth and natural by managing the intonation, rhythm, and timing.

## How IBM Simplifies the Process

Instead of building these algorithms from scratch, **IBM Watson** provides easy-to-use **APIs** for both **STT** and **TTS**. This allows developers to quickly integrate speech recognition and synthesis capabilities into their applications without deep expertise in machine learning.

This project serves as a simple demonstration of how to use IBM Watson's AI-powered services for converting speech to text and vice versa.
